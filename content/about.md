My name is Michael Hausenblas and since that's such an awfully long name, I tend to use a shorter version of it: MH9. Now, as part of my job but also in my spare time I'm coding, mainly Go and shell scripts. Hence the site's name: `mh9 codes`.

## Setup

This blog uses the following setup:

- I maintain the [source](https://github.com/mhausenblas/mh9.codes) in GitHub.
  This is essentially a bunch of Markdown files, and they represent the source
  of truth.
- I'm using the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate
  the Web pages.
- Finally, to serve the site I am using [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/). 
  This includes building a new site when I push changes to GitHub as well as
  DNS and cert management.

appreciate creditd, but they are not required.
