Something that comes up often in the context of testing is the need for a simple 
service that exposes an HTTP API. The simplest non-static service I can think
of is something that replies with the same input that I provide it with.

So, let's have a look at a service written in Go that echos the input provided by
a [query](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986/#section-3.4) parameter:

{{% code file="sources/1636366824/main.go" language="go" %}}

I can run this service as follows, assuming it's stored it in a file
called `main.go`:

```sh
$ go run main.go
```

Now that the service is up and running, I can invoke it (in a second terminal
session) like so:

```sh
$ curl "localhost:4242/echo?this=here"
here
```
That's the simplest way to provide an HTTP test service. Now you can
think about how to package and deploy it, for example, as a container image.

Other things to consider:

* What if I wanted to make the port configurable?
* How can I handle failure scenarios better (e.g. not enough memory available)?
* Could I increase the visibility? For example, instrument it so that it exposes
  Prometheus metrics.

OK, that was it for this time â€¦ stay tuned ;)
