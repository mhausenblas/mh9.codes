Let's have a look at a simple Go service that echo's the input:

{{% code file="static/sources/main.go" language="go" %}}

We can run this service as follows (assuming you've stored it in a file
that's called `main.go`):

```sh
$ go run main.go
```

Now the server side is running and we can invoke it, in a second terminal
session like so:

```sh
$ curl "localhost:4242/echo?this=here"
here
```
