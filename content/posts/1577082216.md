Are you using [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)? If not, why not? Let me debunk some myths and misconceptions in this post and share my `tmux` setup with you in the hope to convince you to start using it as well.

I don't know about you, but I do spend a fair amount of my day in the terminal. Usually, I've got a number of projects open I'm working on, each with its setup such as current directory, environment variables, and so forth:

![tmux overview](../../images/tmux-overview.png)

I first came across [screen](https://linux.die.net/man/1/screen) and wasn't sold. Then, I saw `tmux` in action and thought I should give it a try.

But why did I, before this, not consider using either? What held me back? Well, I suppose, like many folks, I was thinking along the line of:

1. It's hard to learn and has an awkward UX. There are so many cryptic [shortcuts](https://gist.github.com/andreyvit/2921703) and I won't remember most of them.
2. It's only for ops. I don't need it when developing and writing stuff.
3. It's only for working on remote systems. If I don't `ssh` into a box I don't need it.

So 1. is kinda true, not gonna lie. Suck it up and thank me later. Took me a few month to have the muscle memory in place.

And 2. and 3., well, turns out I was so wrong. I do most of my work local (`kubectl exec` doesn't count, right?) and I'm so much more productive thanks to `tmux`. 

How?

A few tips and my setup follow.

## Tip 1: use the plugin manager

When extending and customizing `tmux`, you want to do that in a convenient way. So, use the [tmux plugin manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) (`tpm`). Think of it like the `brew` of `tmux`.

## Tip 2: use a plugin that manages state

You don't want to set up all your projects and the state every time you have to restart the terminal, right? So, use plugins like `tmux-continuum` and `tmux-resurrect` that store info like sessions and allow you to restore it with one command.

## Tip 3: redefine modifier key on macOS

If you're using macOS, [redefine](https://blog.guilhermegarnier.com/2017/12/increasing-productivity-in-tmux-with-a-single-prefix-key/) the `Caps Lock` key to `CTRL` like so:

![tmux overview](../../images/tmux-macos-keybinding.png)

This makes for a much smoother shortcut, if you also change the trigger to `CTRL+A`.

## Tip 4: redefine shortcuts

To make it easier to remember shortcuts, redefine them to stuff that's easier to remember. For example, if I want to split a pane vertically, I use trigger+`|` which looks much more like a vertical split and hence is easier to remember than trigger+`"`. Same for horizontal split: I'm using `-` which defo reminds me of horizontal. Much more than the default `%` does. Seriously? Like, why?


## Example: my setup

All the above tips implemented and a few more things like [themes](https://github.com/rothgar/awesome-tmux), shortcuts for applying config changes, and getting most out of the status bar at the bottomâ€”here's my setup, that is, the content of my `~/.tmux.conf`:

```
# Change trigger from CTRL+b to CTRL+a
unbind C-b
set -g prefix C-a

# Ensure that we can send Ctrl-A to other apps
bind C-a send-prefix

# Reload the file with trigger+r
bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; display "tmux config reloaded :)"

# Splitting panes with | and -
bind | split-window -h
bind - split-window -v

# When splitting panes retain current directory of existing pane
bind _ split-window -v -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind \ split-window -h -c "#{pane_current_path}"

# Source ~/.bashrc with trigger+b
bind b send-keys "source ~/.bashrc" "Enter" \; display ".bashrc sourced :)"

# No delays
set -s escape-time 1

# Enable mouse selections
set-option -g mouse on

# Set base index for windows to 1 instead of 0
set -g base-index 1
# Set base index for panes to 1 instead of 0
setw -g pane-base-index 1

# Set the default terminal mode to 256color mode
set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"

# Theme
set -g status-bg colour231
set -g status-fg colour27
set -g status-right-length 120
set -g status-left-length 50
set -g window-status-current-bg colour231
set -g window-status-current-fg colour27
setw -g window-style fg=colour240,bg=colour235
setw -g window-active-style fg=white,bg=black
set -g pane-border-bg black
set -g pane-border-fg colour238
set -g pane-active-border-bg black
set -g pane-active-border-fg colour27

# Center the window list in the status line
set -g status-justify centre

# Left status: session | battery | date and time
set -g status-left " #[bold]#S #[fg=black]| #{battery_percentage} | %FT%H:%M"

# Right status: Kubernetes context, see https://github.com/jonmosco/kube-tmux
# and AWS context, see https://github.com/mhausenblas/aws-tmux
set -g status-right "#(bash ~/.tmux/aws-tmux/aws.tmux)"

# Resurrect, see https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect
# Restore sessions trigger + CTRL-s (safe) / CTRL-r (restore)
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect'

# tmux-continuum, see https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum
# saves/restores state automatically every 15min interval
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum'
set -g @continuum-restore 'on'

# battery, see https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-battery
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-battery'

# The tmux plugin manager, see https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm:
run '~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/tpm'
```

I hope this post motivated you a little to have a look at `tmux` and maybe give it a try. With above tips applied, it shouldn't be too painful to set up and get started.

Happy `tmux`-ing!
