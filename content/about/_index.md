My name is Michael Hausenblas and since that's such an awfully long name, I tend to use a shorter version of it: MH9. Now, as part of my job but also in my spare time I'm coding, mainly Go and shell scripts. Hence the site's name: `mh9 codes`.

## Setup

This blog uses the following setup:

- The [source](https://github.com/mhausenblas/mh9.codes) is maintained in GitHub, essentially a bunch of Markdown files, and represents the source of truth.
- Content is generated with the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Hugo is fast, powerful and comes with a number of nice themes.
- Serving is done via [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/). This includes building a new site when I push changes to GitHub as well as DNS and cert management.

If you're interested in the setup, maybe want to learn more details, hit me up or reach out to my colleague [Nader](https://twitter.com/dabit3).
